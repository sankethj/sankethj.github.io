      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Gaming Disorder (GD) and the experience of functional impairments
has received considerable theoretical attention in the recent past and current diagnostic
approaches underscore the centrality of functional impairments as a requirement for GD diagnosis.
However, there is limited empirical evidence illuminating the interplay between GD and functional
impairments, particularly among specific vulnerable groups. The present study seeks to bridge this
gap by investigating an English-speaking sample (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 5198) comprising an age- and gender-matched
group of Professional Gamers (PG, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 2599) and Non-Professional Gamers (NPG, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 2599) sub-sampled
from a larger sample of 192,260 individuals. The results revealed that PG were at a greater risk
for GD compared to NPG as the prevalence rate of GD among PG (3.31%) was significantly higher and
almost doubled that of NPG (1.73%), with PG further exhibiting higher overall GD symptom-load and
weekly time spent gaming compared to NPG. Furthermore, PG reported experiencing significantly higher
frequency of gaming-related functional impairments compared to NPG, with the in particular affected
areas for both PG and NPG being &lt;em&gt;‘school and/or work’&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;‘physical health’&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;‘family’&lt;/em&gt;, with other key
differences emerging in relation to other outcomes. Overall, the present findings show that not only
GD symptom-load but also some functional impairment is higher in PG compared to NPG which highlights
the need to develop and support prevention and intervention strategies for this at-risk population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The interplay between time spent gaming and disordered gaming: A large-scale world-wide study</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/publication/2022/</link>

      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background: ‘Gaming Disorder’ (GD) is now an officially recognized mental health disorder according
to the World Health Organization (WHO) framework while ‘Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) remains as
a tentative disorder as per the American Psychiatric Association (APA) framework. Although both GD
and IGD reflect disordered gaming tendencies marked by excessive time spent gaming, little is known
about the extent to which too much time spent gaming becomes particularly problematic. Moreover, emerging
research has highlighted the need to further explore how both disordered gaming frameworks perform in
the assessment and estimation of disordered gaming symptoms and related behaviors. Methods: The primary
aim of the present study was to shed light on the complex relationship between time spent gaming and
disordered gaming and to provide prevalence estimates of disordered gaming across the WHO and APA frameworks.
This study adopted an online survey methodology and a cross-sectional design in a large sample of 123,262
eligible gamers from 168 countries. Results: The results obtained indicated that the prevalence rate
of disordered gaming among the participants was smaller when assessed with the WHO framework (i.e., 1.96%)
in comparison to the APA framework (i.e., 4.97%). Additionally, the relationship between time spent gaming
and disordered gaming varied, and disordered gaming was associated on average with 34.53 h of gaming a
week within the APA framework (i.e., with at least five criteria endorsed; higher gaming-time-averages
for those endorsing more criteria) and an average of 40.13 h a week within the WHO framework (i.e., with all
criteria endorsed). Conclusions: The relationship between weekly time spent gaming and disordered gaming is
multifaceted and varies according to the diagnostic framework adopted. The results highlight the need for
further refinement at the diagnostic level in regard to disordered gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Measurement and Conceptualization of Gaming Disorder According to the World Health Organization Framework:the Development of the Gaming Disorder Test</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/publication/2021/</link>

      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research on gaming disorder (GD) has highlighted key methodological and conceptual
hindrances stemming from the heterogeneity of nomenclature and the use of non-standardized
psychometric tools to assess this phenomenon. The recent recognition of GD as an official mental
health disorder and behavioral addiction by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the 11th
Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) opens up new possibilities to
investigate further the psychosocial and mental health implications due to excessive and disordered
gaming. However, before further research on GD can be conducted in a reliable way and within a robust
cross-cultural context, a valid and reliable standardized psychometric tool to assess the construct as
defined by the WHO should be developed. The aim of this study was to develop The Gaming Disorder
Test (GDT), a brief four-item measure to assess GD and to further explore its psychometric properties.
A sample of 236 Chinese (47% male, mean age 19.22 years, SD = 1.57) and 324 British (49.4% male, mean
age 26.74 years, SD = 7.88) gamers was recruited online. Construct validity of the GDT was examined
via factorial validity, nomological validity, alongside convergent and discriminant validity. Concurrent
validity was also examined using the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale—Short-Form (IGDS9-SF). Finally, reliability
indicators involving the Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability coefficients were estimated. Overall,
the results indicated that GDT is best conceptualized within a single-factor structure. Additionally, the
four items of the GDT are valid, reliable, and proved to be highly suitable for measuring GD within a
cross-cultural context.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Critically appraising the pitfalls of screen time effects research</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/publication/2020-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing recommendations regulating screen time use and studies investigating its effects are
inherently problematic for two main reasons. First, they imply that screen time activities are essentially
the same in nature regardless of what type of digital content is being consumed. This phenomenon has been
described as monolithic screen time, which refers to an assessment approach to screen time implying that all
screen time activities are qualitatively and psychologically equivalent. This assessment may be one of the main
reasons leading researchers to report conflicting evidence in relation to the potential role of screen time in
enhancing and/ or deteriorating psychological health and well-being of users. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1177/0004867420963736&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[continued&amp;hellip;]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A new era for gaming disorder research: Time to shift from consensus to consistency</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/publication/2020-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of the first commercial video games occurred in the early 1970s and it took approximately 10 years
for the first reports of what we would now term ‘Gaming Disorder’ (GD) to emerge in the scientific literature
(Ross, Finestone, &amp;amp; Lavin, 1982). More recently, research on GD has received much public and scientific scrutiny
due to the increasing importance given to this condition by official medical and psychiatric organizations
(Pontes &amp;amp; Griffiths, 2014). This led to three key milestones in the field. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2019.106059&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;[continued&amp;hellip;]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Investigating the differential effects of social networking site addiction and Internet gaming disorder on psychological health</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/publication/2017/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/publication/2017/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background and aims: Previous studies focused on examining the interrelationships between social
networking site (SNS) addiction and Internet gaming disorder (IGD) in isolation. Moreover, little
is known about the potential simultaneous differential effects of SNS addiction and IGD on psychological
health. This study investigated the interplay between these two technological addictions and ascertained
how they can uniquely and distinctively contribute to increasing psychiatric distress when accounting for
potential effects stemming from sociodemographic and technology-related variables. Methods: A sample of
509 adolescents (53.5% males) aged 10–18 years (mean = 13.02, SD = 1.64) were recruited. Results: It was
found that key demographic variables can play a distinct role in explaining SNS addiction and IGD. Furthermore,
it was found that SNS addiction and IGD can augment the symptoms of each other, and simultaneously contribute
to deterioration of overall psychological health in a similar fashion, further highlighting potentially common
etiological and clinical course between these two phenomena. Finally, the detrimental effects of IGD on psychological
health were found to be slightly more pronounced than those produced by SNS addiction, a finding that warrants
additional scientific scrutiny. Discussion and conclusion: The implications of these results are further discussed
in light of the existing evidence and debates regarding the status of technological addictions as primary and
secondary disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Conceptualisation and Measurement of DSM-5 Internet Gaming Disorder: The Development of the IGD-20 Test</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/publication/2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/publication/2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background: Over the last decade, there has been growing concern about ‘gaming addiction’ and
its widely documented detrimental impacts on a minority of individuals that play excessively. The latest
(fifth) edition of the American Psychiatric Association&amp;rsquo;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM-5) included nine criteria for the potential diagnosis of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD)
and noted that it was a condition that warranted further empirical study. Aim: The main aim of this study
was to develop a valid and reliable standardised psychometrically robust tool in addition to providing
empirically supported cut-off points. Methods: A sample of 1003 gamers (85.2% males; mean age 26 years)
from 57 different countries were recruited via online gaming forums. Validity was assessed by confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA), criterion-related validity, and concurrent validity. Latent profile analysis was also
carried to distinguish disordered gamers from non-disordered gamers. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were
performed to determine an empirical cut-off for the test. Results: The CFA confirmed the viability of
IGD-20 Test with a six-factor structure (salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict
and relapse) for the assessment of IGD according to the nine criteria from DSM-5. The IGD-20 Test proved
to be valid and reliable. According to the latent profile analysis, 5.3% of the total participants were
classed as disordered gamers. Additionally, an optimal empirical cut-off of 71 points (out of 100) seemed
to be adequate according to the sensitivity and specificity analyses carried. Conclusions: The present
findings support the viability of the IGD-20 Test as an adequate standardised psychometrically robust tool
for assessing internet gaming disorder. Consequently, the new instrument represents the first step towards
unification and consensus in the field of gaming studies.&lt;/p&gt;
