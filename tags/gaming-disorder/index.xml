This is why in in my latest study,
published in the scientific journal &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2025.102023" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Eating Behaviors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, I investigated how gaming connects
to what we eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer is that when gaming becomes problematic, poor diet often follows, and the strongest bridge between the two is physical wellness
according to the findings of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-study-conducted"&gt;The study conducted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This large-scale study surveyed a nationally representative sample of adults in the United Kingdom. People reported their gaming habits,
their physical and mental wellness, and how often they ate less healthy foods (e.g., sugary drinks, fried foods, and heavily processed snacks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-was-found"&gt;What was found&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with more severe levels of gaming disorder were more likely to report unhealthy eating. They also tended to report lower physical wellness,
such as less regular movement or poorer sleep routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I tested how these pieces fit together, physical wellness explained a meaningful
part of the link between gaming disorder and unhealthy eating. In other words, as physical wellness slipped, diet quality tended to slip too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental wellness did relate to gaming disorder, but it did not explain the connection to unhealthy eating in this study. Perhaps focusing
only on mood or general psychological well-being may miss an important part of the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="practical-implications"&gt;Practical implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are trying to reduce the health downsides of problematic gaming, start with the body. Rebuilding daily routines around movement,
sleep, and simple meal planning could be a practical way to weaken the pull toward less healthy foods (e.g., fast food).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not mean mental health
is unimportant, only that physical wellness may be the most direct lever for improving diet when gaming has become problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-to-keep-in-mind"&gt;What to keep in mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results come from a single-time survey, so we cannot say what causes what. People also reported their own habits, which can be imperfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mental wellness measure used in the study was broad, so it may have missed specific pieces of the puzzle such as emotion regulation or stress
management that could still matter even if the overall score did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="takeaway"&gt;Takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problematic gaming and poor diet often travel together. In this study, the clearest link ran through everyday physical wellness, implying that
strengthening routines for sleep, movement, and basic food choices may be a straightforward way to improve diet while addressing gaming problems.&lt;/p&gt;

the impact of excessive gaming on mental health. In our &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abrep.2024.100567" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;latest study&lt;/a&gt;, we took a closer look at two of the most widely used assessment
tools for GD: the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2014.12.006" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Internet Gaming Disorder Scale–Short-Form (IGDS9-SF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and
the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-019-00088-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Gaming Disorder Test (GDT)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Our goal was to evaluate how well these tools measure
disordered gaming and what that means for individuals and clinicians alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-gaming-disorder"&gt;What is Gaming Disorder?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/frequently-asked-questions/gaming-disorder" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Gaming Disorder&lt;/a&gt; is a condition recognized in
the World Health Organisation&amp;rsquo;s International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).
It involves a pattern of gaming behaviour where a person struggles to control their gaming habits, prioritises gaming over other
important activities and interests, and continues to play even when it leads to negative effects in their life.
Essentially, it means that gaming becomes more important than other aspects of daily living, which can harm a person&amp;rsquo;s wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="about-our-study"&gt;About our study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this study, we gathered a diverse group of 605 participants, all of whom were Spanish-speaking individuals aged between 16 and 73 years
who played video games at least once a week. Through an online survey, we assessed the reliability and effectiveness of the IGDS9-SF and GDT
in identifying symptoms of disordered gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using advanced statistical methods, we analysed the data to determine whether these two scales accurately measure a single underlying trait
(i.e., disordered gaming) and how well they can distinguish between different levels of severity. Accurately measuring Gaming Disorder is
crucial for identifying and treating individuals who may be struggling with excessive gaming and understanding the severity of their issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="our-key-findings"&gt;Our key findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our most significant findings was that both the IGDS9-SF and GDT are unidimensional. This means that each scale effectively measures
one core aspect of Gaming Disorder. The results showed that the items (which represent the unique symptoms of Gaming Disorder) on both scales
work well together to reflect the same underlying issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, both scales demonstrated high reliability, which means that they consistently provide accurate measurements of Gaming Disorder symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also explored how well the items of each scale can differentiate between varying levels of Gaming Disorder. We found that the GDT performed
particularly well, achieving a strong scalability coefficient, which suggests that its items are effective at distinguishing between
individuals with different levels of gaming issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also found a clear hierarchy of item difficulty within both scales. For instance, in the IGDS9-SF, the most challenging item related
to the experience of &lt;strong&gt;negative consequences of gaming&lt;/strong&gt;, while the easiest item was about &lt;strong&gt;escapism&lt;/strong&gt;, which means that when assessing
Gaming Disorder, it is important to understand that the potential negative consequences resulting from excessive gaming is a much better
indicator of Gaming Disorder than playing video games excessively to escape real-life problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the GDT, the most difficult item involved &lt;strong&gt;experiencing significant life problems&lt;/strong&gt; due to gaming, which is highly consistent with the
findings of the IGDS9-SF. Interestingly, the easiest item was related to giving &lt;strong&gt;increased priority to gaming&lt;/strong&gt;, which is an important sign
of Gaming Disorder but certainly not as critical compared to the detrimental consequences excessive gaming can cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also found that &lt;strong&gt;withdrawal symptoms&lt;/strong&gt; (in IGDS9-SF) and &lt;strong&gt;experience of significant problems in life&lt;/strong&gt; (in GDT) were the most discriminative
items. This finding suggests that these two symptoms are particularly effective in differentiating individuals experiencing Gaming Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="implications-of-our-findings"&gt;Implications of our findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of our study are important for both individuals and mental health professionals. Firstly, it is important to pay attention
to more critical symptoms as these may require a greater level of intervention. One of the critical symptoms we identified relates to the
negative impact of excessive gaming on a person&amp;rsquo;s life (e.g., missing real-life opportunities, skipping school, missing work, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the most discriminative items were: &lt;strong&gt;withdrawal symptoms&lt;/strong&gt; in the IGDS9-SF and the &lt;strong&gt;experience of significant life problems&lt;/strong&gt; in
the GDT. These two symptoms should be prioritised during assessments and clinicians should pay close attention to them as they appear to indicate
a more severe form of Gaming Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, our findings suggest that the GDT may be slightly more effective than the IGDS9-SF in distinguishing between individuals with high
and low levels of Gaming Disorder, a finding that can help guide health practitioners in selecting the most appropriate assessment tool for their
clinical work with clients struggling with Gaming Disorder, ultimately leading to better targeted interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, our study supports the psychometric robustness of both the IGDS9-SF and GDT, confirming their utility in both research and
clinical settings for assessing Gaming Disorder. By utilising these tools, researchers and clinicians can better identify individuals at
risk for Gaming Disorder and implement more focussed interventions aimed at treating this condition and promoting healthier gaming behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the conversation around gaming and mental health continues to evolve, our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that can help
shape effective strategies for prevention and intervention in the realm of Gaming Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

This initial study found that the areas mostly affected by functional impairments were &lt;em&gt;‘school and/or work’&lt;/em&gt;, followed by &lt;em&gt;‘psychological health’&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;‘family’&lt;/em&gt;-related functional impairments. Interestingly, it also found that the least affected area related to &lt;em&gt;‘friends’&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this initial investigation, we have conducted a follow-up study narrowing the scope of the analysis. In our most recent follow-up &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-56358-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; published in the journal &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/srep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, we provided a glimpse on the challenges faced by Professional Gamers (PGs) compared to their Non-Professional Gamers (NPGs). We analyzed a sample of 5,198 English-speaking gamers to help us understand the prevalence of GD and associated functional impairments within these communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of GD, officially recognized by the World Health Organization, refers to a pattern of gaming behavior characterized by impaired control, prioritization of gaming over other interests, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite negative consequences. Our findings revealed that PGs exhibited a significantly higher risk for GD—with prevalence rates almost double those of NPGs. This elevated risk is mirrored by an increased symptom-load and more hours spent gaming weekly among PGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked if they had experienced a significant problem due to gaming, PGs reported experiencing more problems compared to NPGs. While the single most predominant area of life affected by gaming-related functional impairments reported by both groups was &lt;em&gt;‘school and/work’&lt;/em&gt;, the second most prevalent for PGs was &lt;em&gt;‘family’&lt;/em&gt; while for NPGs it was &lt;em&gt;‘physical health’&lt;/em&gt;. Interestingly, the third most predominant area of life affected among PGs was &lt;em&gt;‘physical health’&lt;/em&gt; while for NPGs it was &lt;em&gt;‘family’&lt;/em&gt;. In relation to other variables of interest examined in our study, PGs showed higher levels of functional impairments compared to NPG only in relation to overall &lt;em&gt;‘psychiatric distress’&lt;/em&gt; and severity of &lt;em&gt;‘insomnia’&lt;/em&gt; with no meaningful differences emerging in relation to &lt;em&gt;‘loneliness’&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;‘attention problems’&lt;/em&gt;, and severity of &lt;em&gt;‘headache experiences’&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study findings support a holistic approach to GD diagnosis, considering functional impairments as a crucial factor. For clinicians and health professionals, understanding the specific areas of life affected by GD can enhance treatment efforts, ultimately improving the quality of life for those impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the realm of competitive esports, where the line between passion and compulsion can blur, the insights generate by our study not only contribute to our understanding of GD but also emphasize the critical role of industry-led initiatives in safeguarding the wellbeing of gamers. As we move forward, collaboration between researchers, health professionals, and industry stakeholders will be key in developing comprehensive strategies to address the challenges highlighted by this study.&lt;/p&gt;
